# Outer Space Google Doodle
My Google Doodle draws inspiration from outer space as space and extraterrestrial elements have always fascinated me.
The design features pixelated art and an interactive star element. A shooting star also makes an appearance, adding a touch of dynamic movement. This doodle blends my passion for space exploration with playful interactivity, creating a mini-universe within the familiar Google framework.
